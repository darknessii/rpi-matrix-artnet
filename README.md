# rpi-matrix-artnet
Controlling of 32x32 or 16x32 RGB LED displays using Raspberry Pi rpi-rgb-led-matrix with Art-Net and sACN E1.31

Art-Net is a protocol for controlling lights over a network. Glediator / Jinx
controls LEDs on one or more Art-Net nodes. An Art-Net node drives the
LEDs. In this example, Glediator / Jinx runs on a laptop and controls a Pi with
a rpi-rgb-led-matrix RGB LED displays using Raspberry Pi. The Pi is the Art-Net node.
A RGB LED displays 32x32 / 32x16 / 64x64 is an add-on board connected for a Raspberry Pi+/3

## Preliminary

RGB LED displays rpi-rgb-led-matrix Program for Raspberry Pi must be installed and working on the Pi
supplied Python software. Make sure this works before graduating to Art-Net.

## Install libraries on the Pi

Do this only once to install the Python twisted libraries.

```
sudo apt-get install python-twisted
```

## Run Art-Net server rpi-matrix-artnet on the Pi
The following command runs the Art-Net server turning the Pi into an Art-Net node. 
Many programs can send LED values to an Art-Net node. Glediator and Jinx is such a
program.

```
sudo python rpi-matrix-artnet.py
```


## NOT working
* Art-Net Net & Subnet
* no Multicast Support

## TO DO
* Code Clean Up
